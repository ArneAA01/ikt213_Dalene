The program compares two images using feature-matching techniques in OpenCV.

Images are first converted to grayscale and preprocessed using Otsu's thresholding and inversion.

Two feature detection pipelines are used:

ORB + BFMatcher (fast, binary descriptors)

SIFT + FLANN (more accurate, float descriptors)

Keypoints and descriptors are extracted from both images.

Matches are found using KNN and filtered with Lowe’s ratio test to retain only “good matches.”

Results:

ORB + BFMatcher found 35 good matches

SIFT + FLANN found 55 good matches

Conclusion: SIFT + FLANN provided more accurate and reliable matching for the images.
